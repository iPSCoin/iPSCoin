Introduction
In 2006, the team led by Professor Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University produced iPS cells, which are called "dream cells," and in 2006, the team produced a new cell line called "iPS cells.
More than 16 years have passed.
At the time, it attracted a great deal of attention as Japan's first regenerative medicine, and Professor Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2012.
In addition, the world's first transplant operation on a patient was successfully performed.
On the other hand, there are still some challenges, such as cost and lack of data.
iPS coin will promote iPS cell research and other relevant services, and provide a means to resolve such remaining issues.
By utilizing the tokens, patients can easily access a variety of services, including medical care, and
pharmaceutical companies and research institutions will be able to accelerate the realization of various medical treatments by receiving donations of iPS cells for medical use.
Individuals, research institutions, medical care and even other commercial services will be united in building a platform, and iPS coin will be the core to create an ecosystem with shared value between them.
We hope to contribute to the early realization of a future in which patients with intractable diseases will be able to receive transplantation therapy using iPS cells.
